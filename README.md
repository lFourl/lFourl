# Hi, I’m @lFourl
- I’m interested in PC gaming, the outdoors (mtb, rock climbing, camping), IT, and AWS cloud development
- I’m currently learning Cisco networking and AWS cloud developing tools
- I want to use this as a platform to document my _projects_
- How to reach me: don't do that yet lol

**Currently about to take my AWS cloud practitioner certification soon**
